- Hover effects on project cards
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Clean, modern design using Tailwind's utility classes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Font Awesome icons
- Vanilla JavaScript for simple interactions

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with all content

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Navigate through the different sections using the menu

## Experience

Building this portfolio with Tailwind CSS was a great learning experience. I particularly enjoyed:

- The utility-first approach that made styling intuitive
- The responsive design capabilities with minimal code
- The ability to create complex layouts without writing custom CSS
- The hover and transition effects that add polish to the UI

The most challenging part was implementing the typing animation using only Tailwind, but the config extension made it possible.
